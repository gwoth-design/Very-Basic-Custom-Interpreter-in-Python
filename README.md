# Very-Basic-Custom-Interpreter-in-Python
This is the most basic of basic interpreters that is written in python. There are no comments as of yet and the code is aweful and difficult to understand. It is missing For and While loops that I am going to add but I think that will be it.

2. open folder in text edidtor of choice. 
3. run the program and make sure that the "Program.txt" file is in the same folder as the Python file.
4. add some code to the text file and run the python code. 
5. this should all work
